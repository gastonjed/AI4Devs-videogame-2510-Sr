You are an expert game developer. Your task is to set up the structure for a lightweight Space Invaders using Vanilla JavaScript + Canvas. I don’t want to write a line of code myself, so please handle all the necessary file creation and setup.

Inside the folder space-invaders-GDT, add all the necessary files for your game, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If your game requires images or other resources, be sure to include them as well.

Execute the necessary commands using Python to create these directories and files.

Once the structure is created, populate index.html and main.js and verify Phaser is correctly added.
